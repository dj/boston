# Boston Maps
Collection of Boston choropleth maps with [d3.js](www.d3.org) and [Leaflet](www.leafletjs.com).

## Data
The data is taken from the American Communities Survey 2010 5-year estimates and the 2010 decennial census, downloaded via [American FactFinder](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). Cubit published a good [guide](https://www.cubitplanning.com/data/american-fact-finder-census-tracts) to using American FactFinder to download Census Tract level data.

## TODO
+ Add more maps
+ Add another city
+ Display exact tract value in mobile view
+ Add data sets to topoJSON feature properties?
